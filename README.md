# Array data structures
Implemented an array data structure in javascript, to include:
1. get (to access an array index)
2. push (to add an element to the end of an array)
3. pop (to remove the last element of an array)
4. delete (to remove an array element from any index)
5. insert (to add an element to any index in an array)
